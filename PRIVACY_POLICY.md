# Privacy Policy for ChatVault

**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026

## Introduction
ChatVault ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how ChatVault collects, uses, and safeguards your information across the Chrome Extension and related services.

## Data Collection
ChatVault includes a **local-first** Chrome Extension and an optional web experience. 

1.  **Local Storage:**
    *   We use the Chrome Extension `storage` permission to save your chat history, folders, and tags directly on your local device.
    *   By default, this data remains in your browser and is not sent to our servers unless you explicitly enable a sync/account-backed experience.

2.  **User Content:**
    *   We process the text content of the AI chats you choose to save (e.g., from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) solely for the purpose of displaying and organizing them within the extension.

## Data Usage
We use the information collected to:
*   Display your saved conversations in the Popup and Side Panel.
*   Allow you to search, filter, and organize your chat history.
*   Persist your user preferences (e.g., theme settings).

## Third-Party Sharing
**We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.** 

*   ChatVault does not include any analytics or tracking scripts.
*   Your data stays on your machine.

## Permissions
ChatVault requests the following permissions to function:
*   `storage`: To save your chats and settings locally.
*   `sidePanel`: To provide a persistent sidebar interface for managing your chats while you browse.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
