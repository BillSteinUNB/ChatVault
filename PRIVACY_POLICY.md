# Privacy Policy for ChatVault

**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026

## Introduction
ChatVault ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the ChatVault Chrome Extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Data Collection
ChatVault is designed as a **local-first** application. 

1.  **Local Storage:**
    *   We use the Chrome Extension `storage` permission to save your chat history, folders, and tags directly on your local device.
    *   This data remains in your browser and is not sent to our servers unless you explicitly configure a sync backend (if available).

2.  **User Content:**
    *   We process the text content of the AI chats you choose to save (e.g., from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) solely for the purpose of displaying and organizing them within the extension.

## Data Usage
We use the information collected to:
*   Display your saved conversations in the Popup and Side Panel.
*   Allow you to search, filter, and organize your chat history.
*   Persist your user preferences (e.g., theme settings).

## Third-Party Sharing
**We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.** 

*   ChatVault does not include any analytics or tracking scripts.
*   Your data stays on your machine.

## Permissions
ChatVault requests the following permissions to function:
*   `storage`: To save your chats and settings locally.
*   `sidePanel`: To provide a persistent sidebar interface for managing your chats while you browse.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
