2026-01-19: Completed PRD-01: Folder Data Model & Storage

Updated Extension/src/shared/types.ts:
- Modified Folder interface to match PRD requirements (id, name, parentId, color, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Chat interface already had folderId field

Updated Extension/src/shared/lib/storage.ts:
- Added folder CRUD actions to Store interface:
  * addFolder(folder: Folder)
  * updateFolder(id: string, updates: Partial<Folder>)
  * deleteFolder(id: string)
  * moveChatToFolder(chatId: string, folderId: string | null)
- Implemented loadPersistedFolders() function to load from chrome.storage.local
- Updated setupStorageListener() to listen for folder storage changes
- Added initial folder loading on store creation
- Implemented all folder actions with chrome.storage.local persistence

All acceptance criteria met:
- Folder interface exists in types.ts with correct structure
- Chat interface has folderId field
- All folder CRUD actions work in storage with persistence
- Folders persist after browser restart via chrome.storage.local

Note: Test framework not yet set up (PRD-72), so no tests were written.
